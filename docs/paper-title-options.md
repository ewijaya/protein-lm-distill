## Notes for Title Selection

**For high-impact journals (Nature Communications, PNAS):**
- Prefer intriguing titles that hint at unexpected findings (#11, #14)
- Avoid overly technical jargon

**For methods journals (Bioinformatics):**
- Prefer descriptive titles that clearly state the method (#1, #4, #23)
- Technical terms are acceptable

**For ML conferences (NeurIPS, ICML):**
- Punchy, memorable titles work well (#11, #14)
- Can be slightly playful
